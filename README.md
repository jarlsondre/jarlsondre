# Jarl Sondre SÃ¦ther
Welcome to my profile! My name is Jarl Sondre SÃ¦ther and I am a computer science student at NTNU specializing in AI. Throughout project work and internships, I have acquired a great deal of programming experience. In my earlier years, 
most of my time was spent doing full-stack development, but these days I focus more on machine learning. In particular, I specialize in computer vision techniques.

Within the domain of AI, the tools and technologies I have the most experience with are: 
- PyTorch/Tensorflow
- Tensorboard
- MONAI
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn

I also have a ton of experience in general development. For those purposes, most of my time has been spent on the following technologies: 
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- React
- Redux
- PostgreSQL
- Git
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Java/Kotlin
- Django
